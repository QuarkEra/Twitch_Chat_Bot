# Twitch_Chat_Bot
A simple Twitch chat bot written in Javascript from the example found at https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc and expanded with small but useful functionalities such as an uptime command.
 
# How to use
 
First check out https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc and study up on how to get an oauth key for your bot and for more on how a bot works with their IRC. 

Another thing you shoould do is rename the file of the bot to something else and set up a twitch account so your bot can post with it's own identity in your chat.

Take a look at the chat commands and their output messages and customise those to your chat.

Install https://nodejs.org/ for your machine, then you can use a terminal command to activate the bot when you are in it's directory:

#### node yourBot.js
